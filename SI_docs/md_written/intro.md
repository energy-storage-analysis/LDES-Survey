# Generated information about the dataset

The remainder of the supporting information file contains detailed information about the data collection methods, sources, and resulting dataset used in this study, as well as additional text and figures.

The energy capital cost dataset presented in the main text was created with a data collection framework developed for this work. This framework was designed to collect data from a wide range of publicly available sources in a scalable and transparent way. This scalability is important for adding different classes of storage media and materials, as well as averaging out the variation in inherently uncertain material prices. However, these methods mean that a varying number of sources as well as individualized data processing methods went into the formation of each individual datapoint presented in the main text. This, combined with the size of the dataset, precludes citing the source of each datapoint and describing the processing methods used for each source fully in the main text.

We attempted to maintain a combination of transparency and accessibility with a tiered approach to documentation shown in the figure below. This supporting information document contains sections that are intended to allow for a view into the sources, methods, and data of the main dataset and GitHub code repository. The sections below contain dynamically generated tables from codes in the repository. Consolidated ‘Readme’ files from each source are also included which describe the processing steps used for that source, which motivates a well-documented code repository. Finally, for even more detailed information about the exact sources and methods used for each datapoint, the raw datasets and Python processing codes can be found on the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MHDLab-Projects/Energy-Storage-Analysis). Because raw source datasets have been kept as close to the original as possible, the processing codes lay out, in sequential order, the exact steps used to form the input data for a given source.
