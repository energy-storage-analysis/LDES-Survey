# Volumetric costs

The costs associated with certain storage media are more naturally expressed in terms of volumetric ($m^3$) than specific ($kg$) terms. These costs are ultimately converted to a specific basis with the mass density ($kg/m^3$) of the storage medium material. 

The storage of both pressurized gas and gaseous synthetic fuels in underground caverns (LRC, Salt) are determined from the same set of volumetric cavern costs as discussed in more detail below. 

The volumetric costs of various storage tanks are also determined in order to be applied with the energy densities of gaseous and liquid synthetic fuels. The storage of pressurized gas in above ground pressure vessels is instead handled by the Virial theorem limit as discussed in the text. While the 'Feedstock' capital costs calculations presented in the paper for synthetic fuels offer a 'like-for-like' comparison against the other storage media in the dataset, we added additional synthetic fuel storage media based solely on the storage tank for extra reference.  Storage of gaseous synthetic fuel in above ground spherical pressure vessels as well as cryogenic liquid storage of synthetic hydrogen and methane is included. See the associated source descriptions below for more information.
