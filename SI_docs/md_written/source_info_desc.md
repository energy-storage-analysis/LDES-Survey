A wide range of sources were used in the formation of the main dataset used in this study, as outlined in the table below. Each source employed a unique set of processing steps to transform the data it contained into a common format. The detailed processing code can be found on the GitHub repository associated with this publication. The code and associated ‘readme’ files are designed to encapsulate the detailed processing steps to achieve the results. The information in those files is combined in this section along with other statistical information about the prices and/or storage media determined from the source. 

For more detailed information about individual storage media including the material prices that were used to for each storage medium the consolidated storage medium dataset can be found on the GitHub repository at `cap_cost\data_consolidated\SM_data.csv`.
