Gravitational storage media are defined as combinations of materials and a height difference that those materials will be cycled between. 

For Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) the 'material' costs are defined as the cost of excavating a resirvoir per unit mass of water. The cavern costs of 0.261 $/kg are taken from Black and Veatch 2012 and a typical resirvoir height differece of 300 m is used from Sterner and Stadler 2019. 

Storing brine gravitationally in salt caverns has also been proposed, and we use salt cavern and lined rock cavern mining costs with a height difference of 950 m from van Berchum 2014.    

Stacking of materials such as concrete blocks is also included. We treat these approaches together by making storage media out of applicable materials (e.g. concrete, rocks, etc.) with Î”H = 100m, taken from approximate heights proposed for the Energy Vault block stacking system.
