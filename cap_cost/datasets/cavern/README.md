collection of datasets related to cavern storage costs. This is an attempt ot tie together cavern storage costs for both chemical and pressure storage. 

Some data is presented in the literature as $/kg H2. I convert this to volumetric cost with the mass density of H2, then combine with the other volumetric costs in the literature. 
Then this data can be used to caluclate the specific cost of both chemical and pressure storage in caverns. 


TODO: SM data file is manually formed for now.
