This dataset is a collection of datasets related to underground cavern storage costs. The datasets are limited to those that include breakdown of the costs such that the 'material cost' of the cavern as a storage medium can be determined. 

* Salt caverns (Papadias and ETI): The cost of leeching
* Lined Rock Cavern (Papadias): The cost of excavation, concrete, and Liner

The data from Papadias is quoted in terms of \$/kg H2 which is first converted to $/m3 with the density of hydrogen gas at the specified pressure. For both types of caverns a gas pressure of 1e7 Pa is assumed. The speicifc price of different combinations of caverns and working gas is calculated from the volumetric cost and the mass density of different gasses at this pressure.
