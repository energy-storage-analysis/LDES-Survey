[Kale, V., et al. 2018. A comparative study between optimal metal and composite rotors for flywheel energy storage systems. Energy Reports 4, 576–585.](https://doi.org/10/gm8c9v)


This publication contains the materials strength-to-weight ratio of metal and composite materials. This data is the primary source of the materials define the Virial-limited storage media (pressure tanks, SMES, and Flywheels). These different storage media are created during data processing as near-duplicates except for different $Q_{max}$ which depends on the geometry of the system. The $Q_{max}$ for the different types are determined from [Nomura, et al. “Structural Limitations of Energy Storage Systems Based on the Virial Theorem.” IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2017](https://doi.org/10/gjg4k7).


## Development: 

TODO: the tensile strenght of two axes of composite materials is just averaged, see comment in processing script.

## Determining meaning of acronyms
### CRFP: carbon fiber reinforced plastic

I think carbon fibers with an epoxy materx are CRFP, i.e. the plastic can also mean 'epoxy'. Like this

> IM7 is a high elongation, high strength carbon fiber, and the 8551-7 matrix is a high toughness epoxy resin.



T300 is a carbon fiber
