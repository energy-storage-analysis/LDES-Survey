## Development: 

TODO: the tensile strenght of two axes of composite materials is just averaged, see comment in processing script.

## Determining meaning of acronyms
### CRFP: carbon fiber reinforced plastic

I think carbon fibers with an epoxy materx are CRFP, i.e. the plastic can also mean 'epoxy'. Like this
