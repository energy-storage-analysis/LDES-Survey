[Bellosta von Colbe, J. et al. “Application of Hydrides in Hydrogen Storage and Compression: Achievements, Outlook and Perspectives.” International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Vol. 44, No. 15, 2019, pp. 7780–7808](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.104).

This publication contains tabular physical property data on metal hydride hydrogen storage media. The energy density is calculated with the same method as Bellosta (TODO: check and maybe as better way of describing)
