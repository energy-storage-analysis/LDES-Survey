[Tietze, V., Luhr, S., and Stolten, D. Bulk Storage Vessels for Compressed and Liquid Hydrogen. In Hydrogen Science and Engineering : Materials, Processes, Systems and Technology (Prof. Dr. D. Stolten and Dr. B. Emonts, eds.), Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany, 2016, pp. 659–690](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527674268.ch27)

This book contains volumetric costs of spherical pressure vessels that are used to calculate the specific cost of hydrogen storage. The volumetric costs are taken from Table 27.9. The costs are just averaged between all pressures/tank sizes to a single datapoint.
