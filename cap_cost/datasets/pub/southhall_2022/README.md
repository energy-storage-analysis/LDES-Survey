Southall, E., and Lukashuk, L. “Analysis of Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Systems.” Johnson Matthey Technology Review, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1595/205651322X16415722152530.

The data from table 1 was pulled manually to form material prices. The number of hydrogen molecules released under dehydrogenation is used to calculate the total molar Gibbs free energy of the liberated hydrogen gas, which is used along with the weight of the organic molecule to determine the specific energy.

TODO: Currently the enthalpy of dehydrogenation is not taken into account and probably should be subtracted from the hydrogen gas Gibbs energy. This could be handled similarly to Hurskainen 2020 Table 3.
