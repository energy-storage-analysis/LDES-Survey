This publication contains physical property and material price data for liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC). The data from table 1 were pulled manually to form material prices. The molar Gibbs free energy is calculated with the method for hydrogen carriers described in the supporting information. Molecular formulas assigned to each chemical were taken from  [Modisha et al. “The Prospect of Hydrogen Storage Using Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers.” Energy & Fuels, Vol. 33, No. 4, 2019, pp. 2778–2796.(https://doi.org/10/gg9nsz.)

## Development

TODO: Currently the enthalpy of dehydrogenation is not taken into account and probably should be subtracted from the hydrogen gas Gibbs energy. This could be handled similarly to Hurskainen 2020 Table 3.
