The 'average drop-in height of 200m' indicated in section 9.2.2 is used to define a typical pumped hydro resirvoir height difference. This same height difference is used to define block stacking energy storage media, to facilitate comparison with pumped hydro. This height is consistent with summaries of block stacking startups listed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_battery. Various block stacking storage media are defined according to concerete or rocks, essentially the cheapest solid materials in the price dataset that could be feasibly 'stacked'.
