Caclulations of specific energy and price based on the feedstocks of electrochemically synthesized synthetic fuels. The specific energy density is simply the molar Gibbs free energy calculated for the reactions outlined below using standard Gibbs formation energies from the [Engineering Toolbox Website](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/standard-state-enthalpy-formation-definition-value-Gibbs-free-energy-entropy-molar-heat-capacity-d_1978.html). The molar mass used to calculate the specific energy is based on the overall mass of the products or reactanct, not just the product fuel, emulating a closed loop chemical system. The storage material prices are calculated based on the stoichometric inputs of the reactions. For water the price of DI water is used. The price of nitrogen is obtained as cryogenic $N_2$, wheras $CO_2$ is a mixture of cyrogenic and DAC $CO_2$
