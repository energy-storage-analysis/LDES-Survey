# Cryogenic Liquid Storage

Storage medium definitions of synthetic fuel and liquid air stored in cryogenic tanks. liquid methane (LNG) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) stored in cryogenic tanks. 

The latent heat and sensible heat components of liquid air storage are included with a LNG tank with the specific cost for both components calculated based on the liquid density. Therefore the storage cost of the sensible thermal energy (after evaporation) is determined based on the tank required to store the liquid air before evaporation. The physical properties are obtained from the [Engineering Toolbox Website](www.engineeringtoolbox.com). We use the volumetric costs for cryogenic storage of LNG following a [report by Highview Power](https://www.highviewpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Highview-Brochure-November-2017-Online-A4-web.pdf) indicating that cryogenic storage for LAES systems can utilize experience with LNG storage.
