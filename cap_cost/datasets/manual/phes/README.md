# Pumped Hydro

This source determines water reservoir excavation costs, which is used as the volumetric cost of pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) storage media. The baseline 'rock' excavation costs are scaled by the a 'water-to-rock' ratio as described in Stocks 2021. This ratio arises because not all of the volume of a reservoir necessarily needs to be excavated, e.g. if there is already a partial formation of a resirvoir geologically. Water to rock ratio is obtained from the [Bluefield PHES Atlas](https://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/bluefieldatlas/) which contains GIS based data on potential resirvors in Australia and Malaysia. The median 'combined' water to rock ratio (between upper and lower resirvoirs) all locations is used. We assume a best case scenario of 800 m head, which is an upper limit of reversible Francis turbines as descried in Stocks 2021.
