Caclulations of specific energy and price based on the feedstocks of electrochemically synthesized synthetic fuels


The materials costs are calculated based on the stoichometric inputs of the following chemcial reactions. 

The energy density is the molar Gibbs free energy. 


## Ammonia

$ NH_3 < -> \frac{1}{2}N_2 + \frac{3}{2} H_2O $
